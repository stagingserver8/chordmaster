Chord Hero is a simple app that helps guitarists improve their skills, especially playing barre chords.

When I was learning to play the guitar, I always struggled with playing the so-called barre chords.  There were a few songs that I really wanted to play that had an ‘F’ or a ‘Bm‘ chord, which made it almost impossible for me to play the song.

My guitar teacher told me that it would be a great idea if I could practice a little a drill. The exercise involved playing two random ‘easy’ chords that I knew and every third had to be one of the hard barre chord. 

The idea for Chord Hero was born! I set out to create a random chord generator that allows you to practice different chords including the barre ones. The app was created over the weekend with plain-vanilla Javascript and deployed/hosted using Netlify. 

The app has 4 modes; easy, medium, hard and random. The ‘easy’ mode has no barre chords. The ‘medium’ mode alternates with only one barre chord (F), while the ‘hard’ has two popular barre chords; F and Bm. The random mode mixes up all chords including barre chords. 

In addition to the playing modes, Chord Hero has three different speeds which dictate how fast the chords are changing. I would recommend starting at Slow and then graduating into Medium. There is also an alerting ‘click’ sound when each chord changes, although there are some issues with actually hearing the sound on Safari browsers and Chrome on mobile devices.  

If you have used Chord Hero, I would love to hear your thoughts, feedback and any requests and recommendations.
